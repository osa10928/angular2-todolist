# Angular2 Todo-List
This repo features a simple angular2 todo-list application. It served the purpose of introducing me to the angular2 framework. It is easy to setup and run if you decide to run it on your machine, simply follow the instructions below.

### Details About App
First, a couple of details about the application. The app features a simple ToDo-List in which the user can add tasks, check tasks as complete, delete tasks, and delete all completed task. A core aspect of the project is that the ToDo list is saved onto the user's browser localstorage. This means that the application not only requires the browser to have localstorage, but that the saved tasks are obtained from the browser synchronously. Although I would have liked to test out some of angular2's HttpClient Module, the specifications for this project would not allow for it (maybe next time).

## Specifications
Use npm to install the package.json dependencies.
`npm >= 5.5.1`

This app was built using the Angular2 CLI
`Angular CLI: 1.5.4`

## Setup
1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory on your command line interface.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Serve app to your browser by running `ng serve` or `npm start`
5. Open browser and navigate to localhost:4200

You are now ready to interact with the application. Have fun!
